# Introduction to eBPF

In this section, Thomas Graf introduces eBPF and its significance in extending operating systems.

## What is eBPF?

- [**`00:28`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=28) eBPF is a programming language and runtime designed to extend operating systems.
- [**`00:55`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=55) It can be likened to JavaScript or Lua for kernel developers, enabling running programs in the kernel when specific events occur.

## Why eBPF?

- [**`01:49`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=109) Operating systems like Linux are challenging to change quickly, leading to long innovation cycles.
- [**`02:48`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=168) eBPF offers programmability, allowing rapid adaptation to changing requirements and fostering innovation.

# Distinguishing Features of eBPF

This part delves into how eBPF differs from other languages like Lua or WebAssembly and explains its unique characteristics.

## How is eBPF Different?

- [**`03:40`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=220) Unlike Lua or WebAssembly, eBPF is embedded into the operating system, interfacing with the Linux kernel securely.
- [**`04:08`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=248) The key uniqueness of eBPF lies in its integration into the operating system, enhancing security and efficiency.

# Working Mechanism of eBPF

Graf elaborates on the functioning of eBPF through its language, runtime verification, and bytecode compilation process.

## Operational Process

- [**`04:57`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=297) The language used for expressing programs can vary, with C being common; compiled into bytecode for runtime verification.
- [**`05:25`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=325) The runtime embedded in the OS verifies safety, compiles efficiently just-in-time, offering secure execution at specified hook points.

# eBPF Implementation and Usage

Details about who controls the governance of eBFP and where it finds application today are discussed by Graf.

## Governance and Application

- [**`05:49`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=349) The governance of eBFP lies with the EBFP Foundation and open-source communities.

# Detailed Overview of eBPF Usage in Android Operating System

In this section, the speaker discusses the extensive use of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) in the Android operating system for various purposes such as traffic accounting, memory usage tracking, and observability.

## Android's Utilization of eBPF

- [**`06:50`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=410) Android OS employs eBPF for tasks like traffic accounting, CPU and memory usage tracking for applications, and even GPU memory accounting.

## Multi-Cloud Networking with eBPF

- [**`07:18`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=438) Enterprises are leveraging eBPF for multi-cloud networking. An example is S&P Global using eBPF with Sodium to redefine networking paradigms.

## Innovations in Observability through Grafana and I Surveillance Partnership

- [**`07:44`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=464) The partnership between Grafana and I Surveillance aims to enhance observability tools by combining Grafana's expertise with Loki, Tempo, etc., and I Surveillance's sodium tetragon Hubble.

## Enhanced Observability Capabilities Enabled by eBPF

- [**`00:28`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=28) The collaboration introduces new tools for observability. Notable features include embedding Grafana dashboards into Psyllium's Hubble UI for network metrics visualization.

## Security Layer Visibility Enhancement via Tetragon Project

- [**`09:01`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhPrMW5Rbbc?t=541) Psyllium's Tetragon project enhances security visibility by displaying process ancestry and application behavior through Grafana toolsets.
